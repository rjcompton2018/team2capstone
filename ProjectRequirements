#Project Vision
The most prominent issue at many restaurants in this age is the amount of time customers must wait to be seated. Whether it's due to an
influx of people eager to try a new dish, the Saturday evening rush, or an eat-out holiday, customers always desire to wait for as little
time as possible when they arrive at a restaurant. Since nearly every individual in the present owns a cellular device such as an iPhone
or Android, restaurants can utilize this technology to ensure their customers need not wait for sizable amounts of time; all they need
is someone to develop a proper reservation application. During the course of this semester, we will develop an application that will
sufficiently allow restaurants to manage restaurant seating areas and allow customers to reserve seats and be notified when their table
is ready for their arrival.
