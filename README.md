We will be working on Project #2, which has this description or overall end goal:

Is there a way to avoid waiting at a restaurant? Develop a system by which restaurants can manage their table configurations and occupancy online to project wait time for newly requested reservation. Compute wait time intelligently based on average occupancy of each table. Notify reserved party via SMS or Restaurant App about their wait time. Your system shall have the ability to register a restaurant, allow restaurant admin configure various seating areas, tables (fix /reconfigurable), manage queue. Develop monetization scheme associated with such idea and implement it.

10/29/2019 - We are currently at the end of Sprint 4, trying to combine all of our solutions into a single one. We have converted all of the html pages to aspx and are soon going to create the correct formula for the restaurant wait time calculations.
